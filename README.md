# How to run the game

1. **Ensure Java Installation:** Make sure Java is installed on your system. You can check this by opening a terminal or command prompt and typing `java -version`. If Java is installed, you'll see the version information. If not, you'll need to download and install Java from the [official website](https://www.java.com/en/download/).

2. **Locate the JAR file:** Navigate to the directory where your JAR file is located (`BongoBeatsBonanza`) using the command prompt or terminal. 
    - Type `CMD` in the Windows search bar and click on “Run as administrator”.
    - Then write `cd <write location to game here>`

3. **Open the JAR file:** To open the JAR file, type:
    ```bash
    java -jar BongoBeatsBonanza_Slezak.jar
    ```
    ...and hit the enter key.
